# Manchester Game Jam 2014 - Entire Game on One Screen

My main game is grid.py:
    
    python grid.py

This is a simple maze game, except all the future and past states of the game are also visible. (ie. it's all on one screen temporally as well as spatially).

1d.py is my initial attempt at exploring a similar theme with a 1D game.
